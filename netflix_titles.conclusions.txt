	# netflix_titles up to 2020 dataset conclusions	

1. More than 25% of directors are American.
2. The second country with the highest amount of directors is India, with a total of 586 directors.
3. Netflix has been investing in International Movies - most of them are from India (536 out of 1919), much probably as a way to attract subscribers from different countries, considering the amount of subscribers in said country.
4. Approximately 32% of the catalogue consist of TV Shows.
5. Approximately 68% of the titles available were originally released from 2015 on.
6. The top 3 listed in genres are: International Movies, Dramas and Comedies.
7. K-Dramas (132 titles) is more represented than Classic Movies (83) in the catalogue.
8. 32,42% of the catalogue represents TV-MA rating titles - I wonder whether these numbers have changed after making a 'Kids' profile available.

	# Dataset limitations

1. It is not clear where the catalogue studied in question is from. As we know, Netflix's catalogue changes from country to country, making it an important piece of information missing.

	# Further comments

It would be interesting to make a comparative study with a dataset containing audience numbers in order to check whether their choices for the catalogue have been effectively engaging subscribers or not, for example.
