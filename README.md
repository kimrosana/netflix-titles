# Netflix Titles - Case Study

This was a quick and short Power BI project about Netflix titles I took on, and my first one using Power BI!

*****About the dataset*****

- The dataset contains the fact table named ****netflix_titles****, and the dimension tables with information about ****directors****, ****countries****, ****cast****, and ****category****, each in its own sheet.
- The primary key is the show_id column, which is present in all tables and is used to either JOIN using SQL and/or to manage relationships in Power BI.
- Most of the data cleaning and prep was done in Google Sheets, some of it in Power Query (the tool within Power BI) during the loading process.

***Observation***

Unfortunately as I do not have a corporate email, I cannot publish this work online - which is why I am making the file available instead of a link.
